		<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
		<p>Bread Basket (name in progress) is a web and mobile peer-to-peer application that connects grocery stores, non-profits, and
		restaurants with shelters and donation centers. Our mission is to give grocery stores and restaurants with food overflow the technology to communicate
		more efficiently with shelters and centers in need. Donation centers and shelters frequently speak of their lack of access to donations on a regular basis. Grocery
		stores and restaurants regularly throw out edible, usable food because of the time/effort it takes to transport and donate the food. Our technology allows grocery stores, restaurants,
		and other organizations to send a notification to points of contact at shelters and donation centers when goods are available. These notifications allow the donation center or shelter to
		send a volunteer in their network to collect the donation. This creates a direct line of communication from the donater to the donatee. </p>
