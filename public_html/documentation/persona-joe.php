		<h1>Persona: Joe (Small Food Bank)</h1>
		<p>The name of this persona is Joe.  Joe is a man in his 40's, who runs a small food bank with a small team, and often does most of the grunt work himself.</p>
		<p>Joe's food bank doesn't have a large amount of room (particularly for refrigerated food), so they have to be pretty selective about what they take.  He also has to pick up the deliveries in a fairly small truck with no refrigeration, and he often pays for the gas out-of-pocket; trips that end with no actual food being picked up are a significant inconvenience. Joe works with the foodbank entirely out of love for the community; he is not very wealthy, and the food bank he operates does nothave access to a very large pool of resources.</p>
		<p>Joe is not a very technically-minded person, and he does not have access to the latest in technology.  He is most likely going to be using this site on a food bank desktop running an older version of Windows (Windows 7 at the newest), and will likely never be viewing the site on a smartphone.</p>
