		<h1>Persona: Joe (Volunteer)</h1>
		<p>The name of this persona is Joe.  Joe is a man in his 40's, who is part of a small team of volunteers working for a local food bank run by his church.</p>
		<p>Joe's food bank doesn't have a large amount of room (particularly for refrigerated food), so they have to be pretty selective about what they take.  He also has to pick up the deliveries in a fairly small truck with no refrigeration, and he usually pays for the gas out-of-pocket; trips that end with no actual food being picked up are a significant inconvenience. </p>
		<p>Joe works with the foodbank entirely out of love for the community and his faith; he gets no material benefit from his volunteering.  He cares enough that he's willing to personally go above and beyond to help the food bank, but he may not necessarily have the means or time to do so</p>
		<p>This site is a matter of convinence for Joe: it allows him to know when there is a new delivery to pick-up when he's out and about on his daily routine.</p>
		<p>Joe is not a very technically-minded person, and his income is moderate; he'll be getting notifications on an older Android smartphone.</p>
