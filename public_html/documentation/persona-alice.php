		<h1>Alice The Small, Local, Health Food Grocery Store Manager</h1>
		<p>Alice is the team leader and manager at her branch of the local health store. She is environmentally and socially conscious.
		Her small store composts and donates any unsellable food. She is personally invested in the reduction of food waste and the distribution
		of usable goods to people in need. She owns a smart phone and knows her way around the basic functions of a computer, but needs quick, intuitive
		access to apps or software that she uses. Her frustrations include managing her store and employees while putting her best effort into following the
		ethical codes  and considerations of her store. She is not the owner of the store, but is invested in it's mission.
